# Better Skill Capped

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/shepherdjerred/better-skill-capped.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/shepherdjerred/better-skill-capped)

[Skill Capped](https://www.skill-capped.com/) has some great content, but the website has much to be desired. It doesn't have a search functionality, the video player is minimal, and figuring out what to watch next is more difficult than it should be.

Luckily they provide a manifest of all their video data hardcoded right into the HTML they serve! This is a small React app that renders the video data in a nice interface.
